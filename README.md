# calc
This is dumb calculator app which understands the typical syntax of a hardware calculator. It understands commas and dots as decimal points.

For example, -10 + (8 * 2.5) - (3 / 1,5) = 8.
But it won't understand -10 + 8 * 2.5 - 3 / 1.5.

Run "make all" to compile on Linux with gcc.
test -- runs tests
calc -- the calculator app.
